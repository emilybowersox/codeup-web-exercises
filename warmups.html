<h1>JavaScript Morning Exercises</h1>

<script>

    //Exercise 1
    var onMarsRightNow = false;
    console.log(onMarsRightNow == false);
    // console.log(onMarsRightNow == true);


    //Exercise 2
    //Create an array with the names of five of your favorite foods.

    var fav_foods = ["mangosteen", "pizza", "biscuits", "tacos", "water",];
    console.log(fav_foods);

    //Exercise 3
    //Create an array of numbers from 1 to 10.
    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    //the spaces matter to humans, not the computer for this (JS)//
    //or ??//
    //var condensed_number = range[1, 10];//

    //Exercise 4
    //Add 1 item to the end of your favorite food array.
    fav_foods.push("tea");
    //unshift adds new items to the beginning of the array

    //Exercise 5
    //Reverse the favorite food array.
    fav_foods.reverse();
    console.log('Reversed the fav_foods array', fav_foods)

    //Exercise 6
    // Sort the favorite foods array in alphabetical order.
    fav_foods.sort();
    console.log('put in alphabetical order', fav_foods);
    // "sort" automatically puts things in alphabetical order"

    //Exercise 7
    //Sort the favorite foods array in reverse alphabetical order.
    fav_foods.sort().reverse();
    console.log('reversed after alphabetical order', fav_foods);
    //you can do multiple actons at a time
    //technically this could have just been fav_foods.reverse(); because it was
    //already sorted above, but having both is more explicit

    //Exercise 8
    // Create a new array of fruits and add that array to the end of your favorite fruits array.
    var more_foods = ["pear", "apple", "durian", "grapes", "orange"];
    var all_the_foods = fav_foods.concat(more_foods);
    console.log('added two arrays together', all_the_foods);
    //"This method does not change the existing arrays, but returns a new array,
    // containing the values of the joined arrays."

    //Exercise 9
    //Write a javascript FUNCTION called sayHello that, when sent a name like "Douglas",
    //returns the string "Hello Douglas!"
    function sayHello(name) {
        return "Hello " + name + "!";
    }
   console.log(sayHello('Apex'));

    //Exercise 10
    //Write a FUNCTION called firstItem that takes in an array and returns the first item in the array.
    function firstItem(array) {
        return array[0]
    }
    console.log(firstItem(fav_foods));
